# opencve-helm

## DISCLAIMER

This helm chart is in development. It is not intended to be used in production environments!

## Prerequisites

As the opencve docker image is not yet available on docker hub you should download and build the opencve docker image yourself.
```
git clone git@github.com:opencve/opencve-docker.git
cd opencve-docker
docker build . --build-arg OPENCVE_VERSION="1.2.3" -t "opencve:1.2.3"
```

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:D3N14L/opencve-helm.git
cd opencve-helm
helm dependency update
helm install opencve .

# To apply changes to the chart or values execute
helm upgrade opencve .

# To uninstall the chart use - the pvcs will remain on the cluster.
helm uninstall opencve

```

## Caveats

- Please note that the initialization can take several minutes while OpenCVE downloads and imports the CVEs, CPEs and co.
- Even when uninstalling the pvc will remain on the k8s cluster. If you change certain settings (like postgres passwords) you need to delete the pvc manually and let the init container reinitialize it.
